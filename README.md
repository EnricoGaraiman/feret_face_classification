# Face Classification from the Color FERET Dataset using the ResNet Neural Network

This project is focused on developing a facial recognition system using machine learning techniques, specifically the ResNet neural network, and testing its accuracy on the Color FERET dataset. The goal of this project is to explore the capabilities of neural networks in recognizing faces and compare the performance of the ResNet model with that of a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model.
